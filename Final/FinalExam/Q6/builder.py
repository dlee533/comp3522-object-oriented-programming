Draw a UML class diagram that solves the problem outlined below using the
Builder pattern. Name your UML diagram A########_Q6, where A######## is your
student id number. Include the file in this project when submitting for
grading.

You are writing code to model different kinds of offices. Offices
can have multiple conference rooms, bathrooms, cubicles and executive offices.
There may even be duplex offices (Offices with a second
storey). You need to come up with a way to instantiate all these different
kinds of Offices while still allowing for customizability.

Make sure you mention any and all important attributes and methods. You do
not need to specify every getter and setter, but writing the __init__ method
might be a good idea (seeing how this is the builder pattern). Pay attention
to syntax!
